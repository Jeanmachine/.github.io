    <h1>Hello World!This is My First Website!</h1>
    <p>I'm making this to host my portfolio for free. This is a bit of an introductory approach to the artistic tools technology has afforded
      us through its progression. The unique flexibility digital media art offers is fluid in its creativity yet disciplined in its code. 
      This is my attempt at digital media art, please enjoy.

    </p>This "1st" piece was intended to be an interactive game where the user is free to create fun art through the limitation</em> that was coded to be a simple square that can create movement with the mouse.</p>

</p>This "4th" piece reveals the tedious technicalties of three dimensional design</em>using the Solidworks program. It is about 8 hours or work sped up into 2 minutes and 33 seconds</p>

</p>This "5th" piece focuses on the</em>aspects of restaurant service industry that the customer does not get to see. I originally wanted it to showcase the lack of humanization for service industry workers, but decided to capture the charm of Eureka and aspects that allow the funtionality of the restaurant's organization.</p>
