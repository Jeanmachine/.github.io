  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  </p>My name is Jeanie Mun, and I am an art enthusiast that is directing my aesthetic interests towards the ergonomic functionality of products.  </em>. I am a supporter of all underdogs for positive change; I consider design to be an underestimated movement for positive, effective, and efficient social impact. Being aware of one’s influence as a creator, or a designer for mass usage or mass observance, is a power that requires great responsibility. As a student studying industrial design, I am inspired by the encouragement to consider the manufacturing processes, material choice, distribution impacts, etc. Sustainability and environmental consciousness, are design aspects that represent a creator that is aware of one’s impact.  My work here does not reflect a solid familiarity of the digital media art tools to present this very specific philosophy; however, it does showcase areas of aesthetic interest free from the limitations that industrial design notoriously inflicts.</p>

  </p>Art is </em>Before becoming accustomed to using art to correct ergonomic issues in products, my perception of the arts was much more flexible and fluid. It was enjoyable being able to create something again without the barriers that must exist in product design. The reminder in embracing a broad creative approach again was refreshing, and another confirment of how art’s greatest functionality in life is by adding quality to life. Human beings require happiness as a vital need equivalent to food and water.  </p>
