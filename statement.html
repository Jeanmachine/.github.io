  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  </p>My name is Jeanie Mun, and I am an art enthusiast that is directing my aesthetic interests towards the ergonomic functionality of products.  </em>. I am a supporter of all underdogs for positive change; I consider design to be an underestimated movement for positive, effective, and efficient social impact. Being aware of one’s influence as a creator, or a designer for mass usage or mass observance, is a power that requires great responsibility. As a student studying industrial design, I am inspired by the encouragement to consider the manufacturing processes, material choice, distribution impacts, etc. Sustainability and environmental consciousness, are design aspects that represent a creator that is aware of one’s impact.  My work here does not reflect a solid familiarity of the digital media art tools to present this very specific philosophy; however, it does showcase areas of aesthetic interest free from the limitations that industrial design notoriously inflicts.</p>
